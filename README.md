SMUtility
=========
SMUtility is a web-based tool to simplify common tasks in application 
development and other fields. It is based on a plugin system, so that all 
functionnality is implemented by plugins that can be edited, updated or removed 
at runtime.

Installation
------------
SMUtility in itself does not have any external depedencies. All that is needed 
by the system is included in here. However, some plugins might require special 
libraries or other external dependencies. Please read their README for more 
information.
